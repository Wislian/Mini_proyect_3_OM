### Objective:
Develop a musical piece made in open music to use as music for a video game gameplay, maintaining the meaning of the video.

### Explanation of the problem:
To carry out the project, certain essential criteria must be met, such as the creation of an original audio piece, encompassing both its composition and development, using OpenMusic software and utilizing a wide range of its features. This audio should avoid the constant repetition of the same content, ensuring at least one minute of fresh, dynamic music. Additionally, the audio must have a total playback duration of at least two minutes.

### Proposed Solution:
In OM 7.4, we developed the music for the game "Pokemon Anil," a fan remake of Pokémon FireRed, a role-playing game. We drew inspiration from the eerie atmosphere of Lavender Town, a location in the game where Ghost-type Pokémon reside, which also serves as their cemetery. For the creation of the audio, we used resources such as voice, concat, merger, Lisp functions, n-repeat, division, mktree, sort, among other features of the software.

### Conclusion:
In summary, we think we achieved our goal, creating an atmosphere of suspense and terror in both the music and the game. As the character progresses through Lavender Town's tower, the sense of uncertainty about what lies ahead is maintained. Additionally, we adhered to the allotted time for both the video and the music, using the recommended tools for its development.
